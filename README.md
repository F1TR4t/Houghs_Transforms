# Purpose for repository
Our original intent was to use this repository to work on a final project for our Computer Vision course. With the course over and the project graded, I wanted to explore Hough Transforms and have some fun messing around with it. This repository may be updated sparsely.
# What will be contained
The idea is to educate ourselves more with Hough Transforms. Therefore, there will be a wiki in how it works, should work, and how we got it to work along with the code. Discussions are open to if anyone has any questions, have suggestions, or would like to educate us. This is a learning experience for the collaborators too.
