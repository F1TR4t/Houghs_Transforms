# Requirements 
- Must contain Python 3.9.1 or higher
- Install the necessary libararies from requirements.txt
# How to Run
1. For the terminal, run the command python hough.py OR python3 hough.py
2. You will be prompted for a file name. Make sure said file is a png and saved inside the test_images/ directory. Enter only the name. For example, test_images/box.png, I would type box. The program can handle the long names + extensions, so to make life easier: KEEP PNG FILES INSIDE test_images/
3. You will be prompted again for a threshold value. This will depend on your image. Type an integer.
4. Once the program finishes running, your output files will be inside out_images/. You should get file_out.png and file_sin.png (where file is your input file's name). The former will provide to you the original input, the edge detection erformed onto it, then the resulting lines found. The latter shows neat sinusoids and its peaks.
5. ENJOY!!
